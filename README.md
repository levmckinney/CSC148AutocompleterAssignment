The Autocompleter Assignment made use of two implementations of a "prefix tree" data structure, which allows clients to autocomplete on text or music from .csv input files. Further details regarding the assignments can be found at David Liu's [course website](https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc148h/fall/assignments/a2/handout/a2.html).
