The above graphic is property of David Liu from the [Assignment 2 Handout](https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc148h/fall/assignments/a2/handout/a2.html).

The Autocompleter Assignment made use of two implementations of a "prefix tree" data structure, which allows clients to autocomplete on text or music from .csv input files. Further details regarding the assignments can be found on David Liu's course website: [Assignment 2 Handout](https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc148h/fall/assignments/a2/handout/a2.html).

To run this project, you will need python 3.0 or grater, and pygame installed.
